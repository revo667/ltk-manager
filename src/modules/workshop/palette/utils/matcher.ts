/**
 * What a search query is, and what it matches.
 *
 * Plain substring matching, and the twin of `crates/ltk-manager-base/src/matcher.rs`.
 * The two must agree on order, so `__tests__/ranking.fixture.json` is checked by
 * both suites. Change one and the other's fixture test fails.
 *
 * A query is split on whitespace and every term has to appear, which is the
 * search a file manager does and the one a modder expects. Subsequence matching
 * was the first attempt and it is the wrong default here: `nasus` has its five
 * letters in order inside nearly every long asset path, so it matched 137,032
 * files of a live install and buried the four that were wanted.
