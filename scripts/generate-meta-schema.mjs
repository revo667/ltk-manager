// Refreshes the embedded meta schema snapshot from the meta wiki's own
// repository, rather than from the API that serves the same file.
//
// The API sits behind Bot Fight Mode, which challenges a datacenter address and
// cannot be excepted, so a release runner is refused - see
// docs/research/meta-api-reachability-from-ci.md. The two are the same bytes,
// and lol-meta-wiki is public, so reading the file directly is what makes this
// work unattended. The runtime keeps reading the API: a user is not challenged,
// and the API is the interface published for them.
//
// The database carries its own generation and reach, so it is fetched first and
// compared afterwards. That costs a download the old two-request shape could
// skip, and buys one source that cannot disagree with itself.
//
// The runtime cache's If-None-Match path is deliberately not repeated here. Its
// tag comes back weak on the gzip GET and strong on HEAD, and a script holding
// no state has no tag to send anyway.
//
// `--check` runs the comparison, writes nothing, and exits non-zero when the
// snapshot is behind. `--force` writes whatever the comparison says.
