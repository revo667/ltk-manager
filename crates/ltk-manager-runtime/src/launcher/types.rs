//! The launch shapes that cross the IPC boundary, owned by the manager.
//!
//! Each type here mirrors one from [`ritoclient`] - same fields, same wire
//! spellings - and converts from it. Mirroring rather than re-exporting is what
//! makes an upstream rename a compile error in this file instead of a frontend
//! union that quietly disagrees with the backend.
//!
//! Every enum upstream is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so every mirror carries a
//! catch-all. It says the value is unknown rather than guessing at its nearest
//! neighbour: a variant landing there means this file needs a real one, and
//! wearing another variant's name would hide that.
