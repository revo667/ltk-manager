//! `audio/bank-version` - an audio bank the game's reader will not load.
//!
//! The reader gates a bank on the generator version in its header, and the gate
//! is conditional on what the bank holds. The version it takes as current loads
//! whatever it carries. An older version, down to a floor, loads only if it
//! carries nothing beyond its media index and its media blob - so a legacy
//! media bank loads, and a legacy bank carrying the objects that hold events
//! and sounds does not. `ltk_wwise` implements that gate as `Bank::check`, and the
//! rule reads every bank through it.
//!
//! A rejected bank is dropped **silently**. Nothing is written to the log and
//! nothing is shown, so a mod whose sounds never play looks like a mod that
//! works, which is why this is worth a check at all.
//!
//! Two things keep the rule honest, and both are refusals:
//!
//! - **The version alone is not the predicate.** Most legacy banks in the wild
//!   are media-only and load perfectly, and the game itself ships hundreds of
//!   them. A rule keyed on the version would report every one.
//! - **The rule judges downwards only.** A bank at or above
//!   `BankVersion::CURRENT` is never reported, and its check is a head read of
//!   the version. Judged downwards a stale constant goes quiet rather than
//!   calling every newly authored bank defective, and the class this reports
//!   stays reported, because a bank at an old version does not become valid
//!   later.
//!
//! A legacy bank that `ltk_wwise` cannot read is reported with the reader's
//! error. The client reads chunks in sequence and fails on the same files.
//!
//! # The repair
//!
//! An overlay archive is the game's own archive with the mod's overrides
//! layered over it, so removing a mod's bank does not leave a hole - it leaves
//! the bank the game shipped. On the ordinary sound mod that is not a
//! consolation prize: the mod ships its media bank as well, that one loads, and
//! the game's own events then fire against the mod's media. **The repair does
//! not restore the game's audio, it makes the mod play the audio its author
//! shipped.**
//!
//! What deletion has to answer is therefore not "does anything reference this
//! file" but *after removing it, can every request for it still be answered*.
//! Those give different answers, and the difference is the whole guard:
//!
//! | Asked for by a bank unit | The install holds the path | Verdict                        |
//! | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
//! | yes                      | yes                        | remove - the game's own answers |
//! | yes                      | no                         | refuse - nothing would answer   |
//! | no                       | either                     | remove - nobody asks            |
//!
//! Reference alone is the wrong axis. It says who asks, and only the install
//! says who can answer.
